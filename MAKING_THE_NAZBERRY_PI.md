# Making a Nazberry Pi

OK, this isn't that complicated, nor is it particularly inventive. And the code is *really* primitive. You will need:

- Raspberry Pi version 3
- SenseHAT sensor board
- Small snack container (Lakeland plastics)
- 4 small screws
- 4000mAh phone charger battery
- Charger lead (don't use the one you get with the charger - use a better one)
- Roll of insulation tape

The phone charger battery was a cheapo one from Home Bargains, and 4000mAh gives you a nice long run on the Pi. You may wish to get a better USB cable than the one that comes with the unit - I found that the original ones fail a fair bit, and this resulted in me losing some data and having to reset the Pi.

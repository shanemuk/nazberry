# Making a Nazberry Pi

OK, this isn't that complicated, nor is it particularly inventive. And the code is *really* primitive. You will need:

- Raspberry Pi version 3
- SenseHAT sensor board
- Small snack container (Lakeland plastics)
- 4 small screws
- 4000mAh phone charger battery (Home Bargains)
- Charger lead (don't use the one you get with the charger - use a better one)
- Roll of insulation tape

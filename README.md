# Shane's Nazberry Pi adventure
Data etc from the NazberryPi project - biking from Petra to Nazareth via the Dead Sea, March 2018

**Nazareth** is a town in northern Israel-Palestine with a largely Arab population. I first visited as a medical student in 1993 and fell in love with this crazy noisy messy little city and its wonderful people. I spent a couple of months there before returning to Northern Ireland and resuming my studies. Years later, in 2009, I joined a charity bike ride along the Jordan Valley to raise money for the hospital. I returned in 2016 and 2018 for more bike rides - each one an exhilarating experience, with a joyous warm welcome in Nazareth at the end.

On our last ride, I decided to do some science! I wanted to log my **Strava** GPS data and also some environmental data - temperature, pressure, humidity - but how to do that on a bike? The answer was the #NazberryPi project!

And here, I'm going to share the data, and show you how I built the **lowest** Raspberry Pi computer on the planet!
